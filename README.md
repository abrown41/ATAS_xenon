The bin directory houses the analysis scripts used to extract ATAS from the raw
RMT files. This does not include the gen_tas.py script which is already part of
the rmt repo. The archer_files directory contains a utility for setting up
calculations, and the necessary input.conf file to make that work. It will need
editing to work on your archer account. 

The data which has already been generated amounts to >10Gb so I haven't put it
here. Instead, I've created an archive on
/work/e585/e585/shared/xenon_data_for_lynda.tar which you can pull in. 

There's a separate .tar file (incase you already started to extract the first
one) with the H, D* and Spline* files from R-matrix I. That's on 
/work/e585/e585/shared/xenon_input_for_lynda.tar.
